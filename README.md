# election-county-prediction
cs 4780 final project - We will be working with Tensorflow for this project.

## Virtual Env
This will make sure that everyone is working on the same python environment so that we don't run into issues there.

Assuming Python 3.6.9 or greater:

First setup a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment, this changes the env just a local copy of python
```
. venv/bin/activate
```

Install the same set of modules that every one else is using:
```
pip install -r ureq2.txt
```

### Post Install - How to do daily work
You will need to load into the virtual environment everyday when coding.
```
. venv/bin/activate
```

You might also need to change which python you're using. Do not use your system install, use the venv python.
You can select the right version of python in the top right.
